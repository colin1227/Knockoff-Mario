### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

The above key will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Project Workflow - 2

For the project workflow, you are missing your README file, so this section was more challenging to evaluate. 
This was one of the items I had asked for you to redo and push to github, so I'm not sure what happened here.

In regard to meeting the requirements, excellent job with making last minute changes based and having to
overcome the challenges with learning Canvas. These challenges required you to make changes to your original
proposal, which provided a good learning experience.

## Technical Requirements - 2

Congratulations on meeting the technical requirements! You were very brave in choosing to use
canvas for your project. This is not a very easy tool to use in the beginning. However, 
I am confident that with more time, you will fully grasp canvas
and be able to more things in the future

## Creativity - 2

Although the majority of time was spent writing the logic instead of the styling for this project, your approach
to solving the multitude of problems you had to face was very creative. Excellent work here Colin!

## Code Quality - 2

Your code quality has greatly improved over the month you've been in class! Excellent work Colin! 
You added plenty of comments that provide wonderful context to your code. Thank you for removing the majority of
console logs. There were a couple instances however where you had commented out code that wasn't functional; 
this was an item that was brought up after presentation day where I mentioned to be sure to remove all non-functional code 
and console logs. This is definitely something you will naturally improve on as you grow as a developer 
and build future projects

## Deployment - 3
You successfully deployed your application on the web! Congratulations Colin!

## Total 11 / 15

Excellent work for project 1 Colin! I really appreciate your hard work and courage for taking on canvas, which
was no easy feat for your first project. I am confident you will go on to become a brilliant developer in no time.

Keep up the impeccable work ethic and focus!
